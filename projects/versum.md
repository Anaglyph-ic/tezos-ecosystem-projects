Versum was built with a strong commitment to art and creators by a team of hicetnunc-alumni from across the world, it is a next-gen NFT platform and metaverse that provides unique functionality on a smart contract level that prevents copyminting, botting and other types of issues for collectors and creators.

Versum's NFT-tokens, "Items", has additional features, both on- and off-chain, such as multiple quality levels of decentralized media representation generated on mint and infusions to enable tokens to be used for decentralized p2p-PvP/PvE mechanics.
